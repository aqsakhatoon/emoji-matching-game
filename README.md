# Emoji-Matching-Game

## Match All Emojis in under 60 seconds!

#### Instructions:
In 60 seconds or less, the player has to find all the matching emojis. This game is only played by one player. 
If the lose, a "Reset Timer" will pop up so the player can try again!

#### Tech Stack:
- DOM Manipulation
- Flex Box for boxes to hide the emojis

#### Wireframes:

(it will look different, as I want to style it differrently, this is just what it'll include; a timer, boxes to hide the emojis, play button, etc.)

#### MVP:
- Render a matching game that has 12 emojis you have to match
- Have a functional button to restart game
- Render all emojis to function

#### Stretch Goals:
- Create levels

#### Potential Roadblocks:
- Flex boxes aren't symmetrical
- Timer doesn't work
